# Propeller Manager - *do more with the Propeller*

Propeller Manager is more than a download tool; it is a complete API and toolset for managing Propeller devices, no matter where they are.

### Design Goals

* Full IDE integration
* Persistent sessions for painless cross-platform debugging
* Clean, object-oriented Qt implementation
* High-speed downloading
* Download over Wi-Fi
* C++ API and `propman` command-line interface

#### Stretch Goals

* Spin code bootstrapping for custom download applications

**NOTE: This project is in the early design stages**
